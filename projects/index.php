		<span class="title">Makerspace for Camp Riley</span><br>
		For the last 5 years, I was a camp counselor at an acadmic YMCA day camp. I contributed greatly to the science, technology, engineering, and mathemtics part of the camp. I recreated a Makerspace based on a blog made by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thetech.org/">The Tech</a>. I used <a target="_blank" href="Makerspace.pdf">this "cookbook"</a> to create a new project for the camp each week. Some projects were using playdoh and fruit to create circuits, making paper aircraft fly in a wind tunnel, making rockets out of construction paper, and making games in a program called Scratch.

		Wolverine Soft is the video game design club at the University of Michigan. As the webmaster of the club, my job is to maintain the site. A large part of my job has been fixing old code and updating outdated parts of the website. I have also begun to created new functionality which will be added soon.

    	This website was my first big project. It started as a "Hello World" website, used for learning web design. It become a home page for me with links to my common websites using MySql databases. I have since heavily intergrated Riot Games API. The site can look up a summoners game information. It also displays server information. I hope to expand the page to having a working log in function.
