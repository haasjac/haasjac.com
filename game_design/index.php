        Small Fry was made in 48 hours with a team of 4. This is one of the more well rounded games I have made. You play as a fish, Small Fry,  who must complete 3 mini-games to restore peace between the fish and the birds.<br>

    	<span class="title">The Horsemanless Head</span><br>

    	The Horsemanless Head was the first significant game I made in a team environment. You play as a jack-o-lantern running from the headless horseman. The controls are difficult, and the game lacks vision cues, but it is fun to play if you like a challenge, and it was an amazing learning oppurtunity.<br>

    	<span class="title">Dungeon Duos</span><br>

    	Dungeon Duos is a multiplayer dungeon crawler. The two players must work together to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and progess through the dungeon. The first level of the game is by far the best tutorial of any game I have worked on.<br>

		Rift Raft is a muliplayer brawler. The background image of the game serves as a unique health system. Your character cannot directly hurt the other player, instead you must knock your opponent into stage hazards.<br>
