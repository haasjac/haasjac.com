<div id="about">
This is a selection of the information obtained from Riot Games API about a spell. AP is calculated as the given Ability Power multiplied by the coefficient of spelldamage. AD is calculated as the given Attack Damage multiplied by the coefficient of attackdamage. CDR is calculated as 1 minus the given Cooldown Reduction multiplied by the max rank cooldown.
<br /><br />
Finally the efficiency of the spell is calcuated by: (AP + AD) / CDR.
